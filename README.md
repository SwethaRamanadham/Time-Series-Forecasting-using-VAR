# Multivariate TimeSeries forecasting using VAR

VAR is one of the basic multivariate time series forecasting models.

Main objective was to understand how the VAR model works.Hence the model is built on a default dataset available in R called 'Canada'

It has variables like : ‘e’ is used for employment,‘prod’ is a measure of labour productivity,‘rw’ assigns the real wage.
‘U’ is the unemployment rate.The sample range is from the 1stQ 1980 until 4thQ 2000.
